/*
Testing is the process of checking whether your code or application works as expected and finding any bugs or errors before users do.
automated testing : using code to test code 


ðŸ§ª Manual Testing (your Amazon project)
Manual testing is when you test your app yourself, in the browser.

For example:
You open checkout.html.
You select a delivery option.
You check visually if the delivery price updates correctly.
You refresh the page to test if the cart items are still there.
âœ… You're clicking, checking, and verifying all features work â€” by hand.


ðŸ¤– Automated Testing (your Amazon project)
Automated testing is when you write JavaScript test code (e.g., with Jest) to test if your functions behave correctly â€” without opening the browser.
In the above eg : we now deliverydays are only 7 , 3 , 1 not other than that , so we wil pass each of this number to get the shipping price , so that we wont need to open our 
project in chrome tab and then select deliveryDays to check the shipping price , here we can see that instantly in console after runnig this file 
Thats what testing is
